# Splash

This is a mock website for a marketing agency called Splash. The website will be used to inform possible clients of the abilities Splash has. Just as important it must also highlight the attitude and identity of Splash as a company. It should achieve this while keeping the website simple but sharp. Four pages will be used, each will have the exact content needed to achieve these goals.
